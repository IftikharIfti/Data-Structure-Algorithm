problem:                        solution:
                                
--an array;                     -- as we have to find the minimum value 
                                   by and operation, we can say that
                                   we can minimize the maximum value 
                                   by using and on the minimum value with the
                                   rest of the value ;
                                   because we have to use and operation 
                                   and operation among themselves;
                                   so the final ans will depend on the and operation;
--and operation with all its 
elements
--make the largest value as 
small as possible;
