problem:
--------------------                                                       
--a string;
--we have to get the 
corresponding same string
of regular bracket sequence;       


--we must find if the bracket
sequence ok or not


solution:
------------------------
--as it is a bracket sequence problem
by default its solution will be generated by
using stack. means popping and pushin

-- another possible way is taking all case
-- for every letter we can take either first bracket or second bracket
-- so we can say A,B,C can have in total 2*2*2 = 8 cases;
-- we can denote ( as '1' and ) as '0'
-- so for 8 cases we can get 000 to 111 (0 to 7);
-- at first we will substract A from every character to get 0/1/2 ;
-- then use it for right shifting 0 to 7;
-- if int = 0 and case is 001 then it we will get 1 means '('
-- if int =1 and case is 001 then 1 right shift resulting to 0 will get ')'
-- we can keep a counter ,increamenting(for '(') and decreamenting(for ')') 
-- if counter gets less than 0 then automatically ans is "NO" 
-- bcz less than 0 will only occur when there is no ( but after getting ) still decreamented;
